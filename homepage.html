        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p></p> 
        <p>As a recent Master of Geological Sciences graduate from MSU, I am looking forward to applying my knowledge of geology and geophysics in a practical setting. During my studies, I particularly enjoyed the fieldwork component of my degree program. I am interested in working on-site to do data collection and evaluation of geologic data for the purpose of geotechnical assessment and remediation projects.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As part of my education, I have participated and assisted in leading a variety of exploration projects in the field ranging from undergraduate college instructional courses to National Science Foundation funded science projects. I have a comprehensive understanding of both constructing and interpreting geological maps and cross sections and have the ability to prepare detailed reports and presentations on the findings.</p>  
        <p></p>
        <p>My skills include a comprehensive working knowledge of the Microsoft Office Suite, as well as data analysis software such as MATLAB and mapping and visualization software such as GMT and OpendTect. My previous field experiences have given me the ability to work well with diverse teams of specialists to achieve specific project goals. My current work as an environmental field technician monitoring asbestos abatement projects has given me experience working in the field and the communication skills necessary to keep multiple parties informed of progress and in compliance with state regulations.</p> 
        <p></p>
        <p>I am interested in continuing my education and professional development of my skill set. I recently completed the MDEQ industrial storm water operator program and await certification. I am interested in obtaining my professional geologist certification. I am willing to relocate and travel; I have a reliable driving record.</p>
