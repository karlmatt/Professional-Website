        <h3>Dissertation Topic: The Origin and Implications of a High Amplitude Magnetic Anomaly on the Eastern North American Margin</h3>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Understanding the origin of the Hudson Fan Magnetic Anomaly Highs (HFMAH) on the Eastern
           North American Margin (ENAM) has implications for the rifting processes that formed the
           Atlantic seafloor. The origin and implications of HFMAH were explored in this research using
           magnetic forward modeling based on newly acquired high-resolution sea surface magnetic
           anomaly data with multi-channel seismic (MCS) for a source geometry constraint. The modeling
           results show that the two peaks of the HFMAH are reproducible by two highly magnetized
           bodies in the crust, the locations of which coincide with two zones of rough basement
           topography observed in MCS. It is proposed that the HFMAH is due to the crust emplaced by a
           propagating rift that accommodated rapid changes in directions and spreading rates during the
           very early stage of the Atlantic opening that formed the ENAM.</p>

        <h3>Senior Project Topic: Experiments on the Melting Curve of CaCO<sub>3</sub> at 6GPa</h3>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The melting curve of calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is poorly constrained at high pressures. Previous experiments conducted at the University of Michigan and elsewhere have collected data that suggest different melting curves for CaCO<sub>3</sub> at high pressure. In order to better constrain the melting curve of CaCO3 at 6GPa several sinking sphere experiments were conducted using the 6-8 multi-anvil apparatus at the University of Michigan. The results of these experiments were analyzed in the Mineral Physics laboratory using optical microscopy in addition to Raman spectroscopy. These experiments offer some support to the resistance method based data collected by Zeyu Li, while contradicting the results of the study by Suito et al (2001).  However, more data is required to support these results and conclusively constrain where the melting point of CaCO<sub>3</sub> is at 6GPa. In order to achieve this, several revisions need to be made to the methodology of these experiments to facilitate reproducibility.</p>
